# Token Contract (BlackRock Token)

**Simple overview of use/purpose:**

In this project we need write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix.


## Description of the project

This project involves writing a smart contract to create an ERC20 token named BlackRock (symbol: BLRK). The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens to specified addresses, while any user can burn their tokens and transfer them to other addresses. The contract is written in Solidity and can be deployed using HardHat or Remix.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the contract:

#### Using Remix IDE
* Open Remix at [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
* Create a new file and paste the contract code.
* Compile the contract.
* Deploy the contract using the Remix interface.


### For common issues:
* Ensure your Solidity version matches the pragma statement in the contract (`^0.8.20`).
* Verify that your wallet address is properly configured when deploying or interacting with the contract.
